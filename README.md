# SortingAlgorithmsBenchmarking
Sorting Algorithms Benchmarking
The purpose of this project report is to examine, understand and discuss the results of a Java application that was written to benchmark 5 different sorting algorithms: First – “Bubble” Sort, second “Merge” Sort, third – “Quick” Sort, fourth “Radix” Sort and last fifth - “Shell” Sort. 
In this report, I've introduced and discussed relevant concepts, like time and space complexity and five sorting algorithms that were chosen to be used in the application that benchmarked them. 
Finally, I've described the implementation of the application and discussed the results of the benchmark.
